to exit the virus go to task manager and go to windows based script then click end task.

all you have to do is to create the shortcut and name it Control Panel (or whatever else you wish to name it to)then right click and click properties then click change icon , and select the icon that matches your name, in this case , the control panel icon.

If you wish to change it from control panel to something else you are free to do so.

If you do tho, You will have to change the icon of the shortcut and the name of both

the original file and the shortcut.
